Intro:
-learn representations from speech audio using self-supervision (no labeled data)
-wav2vec masks speech input into latent space and solves contrastive task defined over a quantization of latent representations which are jointly learned
-mask out frames in audio
-latent space: similare DP are closer together
-quantized = discrete latent space
-low amount of data
